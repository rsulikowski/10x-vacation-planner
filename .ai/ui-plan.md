# UI Architecture for VacationPlanner

## 1. UI Structure Overview

VacationPlanner is structured around isolated authentication routes, a global layout for authenticated sections, and a project-detail view with tabbed subviews. Authentication screens live outside the main layout. Once authenticated, users navigate via a top navigation bar to "Projects" and "Profile." Within a project, a tabbed interface hosts Notes and Plan views. Common components (spinner overlay, toast notifications, form fields) ensure consistent UX, accessibility, and security.

## 2. View List

## 3. User Journey Map

1. User lands on `/auth/login`.  
2. Registers or logs in.  
3. Upon success, redirected to `/projects`.  
4. (Optional) Navigates to `/profile` to set preferences.  
5. Back at `/projects`, clicks "New Project" → fills and submits form → project appears.  
6. Clicks project card → lands in Notes tab.  
7. Adds multiple notes via modal.  
8. Switches to Plan tab, clicks "Generate Plan" → sees spinner, then schedule or error toast.  
9. Views schedule, navigates back to Projects or Profile.

## 4. Layout and Navigation Structure

- **Global Layout**: Top nav bar with links to Projects and Profile, user menu for logout.  
- **Auth Layout**: Full-screen routes for login, register, reset, without global nav.  
- **Project Detail**: Breadcrumbs (Projects > Project Name), tablist for Notes and Plan.  
- **Modals**: Create/edit forms open as overlays with focus trap and escape handling.

## 5. Key Components

- **NavBar**: Accessible navigation links, user menu.  
- **AuthGuard**: Redirects unauthenticated users to login.  
- **FormField**: Label, input, error message wrapper for inline validation.  
- **DatePicker**: Accessible date selection with aria attributes.  
- **AutocompleteInput**: For place tags and profile categories, aria-combobox.  
- **InfiniteScrollGrid**: Loads paginated data lazily with aria-live.  
- **NoteCard**: Displays truncated note, clickable region for modal.  
- **Modal**: Generic overlay with focus trap.  
- **SpinnerOverlay**: Full-screen spinner with aria-busy.  
- **Toast**: Non-blocking notifications, aria-live polite.  
- **Tabs**: Semantic tablist/tab elements with role attributes.
