# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - VacationPlanner

## 1. Product Overview

VacationPlanner is a web application that allows users to save and manage free-form notes about planned trips, group them into travel projects, and generate detailed trip plans using AI. Users define attraction priorities and planned dates, and the system automatically creates a daily schedule according to their preferences.

## 2. User Problem

Planning engaging and interesting trips is time-consuming and requires knowledge about destinations and time management. Users need a tool that transforms loose notes about locations and times into ready-made itineraries that consider priorities, group size, and travel preferences.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- Registration and login (email/password) with email verification, expiring links, and password reset capability
- Profile page with the ability to save user travel preferences
- CRUD operations for travel projects with metadata: name, approximate duration, planned date
- CRUD operations for notes within a project: free-form text with location tags, attraction priority
- Generate an AI plan in a single synchronous request, returning a daily schedule
- Display a spinner "Generating plan..." and handle errors with a clear message and a "Try Again" option
- Log AI interactions in a separate table (prompt, response, status, execution time)

## 4. Product Boundaries

- No sharing of plans between accounts
- No advanced multimedia support (e.g., images)
- No sophisticated logistics or time planning
- No admin panel in the MVP
- AI log retention is not required
- No service monitoring or alerting for AI failures
- No monthly summary reports of generated plans in a "My Reports" section
