1. Isolate authentication screens in dedicated full-screen routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/reset`) separated from the main layout.  
2. Implement global navigation with “Projects” and “Profile”; within a project, use tabs for “Notes”, “Plan” and “Logs”.  
3. In the Notes tab, display each note card truncated to 300 characters with “…” and allow click-to-expand and edit.  
4. Use a card grid with infinite scroll in the Notes tab and provide a priority filter control.  
5. Target only desktop web for MVP; mobile layouts are out of scope.  
6. Ensure WCAG AA compliance across all interactive components.  
7. Manage state initially with React hooks and context (optionally add Zustand later).  
8. Handle validation errors inline, show overlay spinners for loading, and use toast messages for non-critical success/info feedback.  
9. On “Generate Plan”, show an overlay spinner, disable the button, and allow retry on failure.  
10. Defer JWT-based token storage and refresh flows to a later stage; protect routes via an AuthGuard.  
11. Omit the AI logs view from the MVP (to be implemented later in an admin panel).

<matched_recommendations>
1. Dedicated full-screen auth routes (Recommendation #1).  
2. Global nav + project-detail tabs for Notes/Plan/Logs (Recommendation #2).  
3. Infinite scroll card grid with filter controls (Recommendation #3).  
4. WCAG AA via accessible primitives (Recommendation #5).  
5. Inline validation + overlay spinners (Recommendation #7).  
6. Plan generation overlay spinner and retry (Recommendation #8).  
7. Protected routes with JWT/AuthGuard (Recommendation #9).  
8. Astro scaffolding + React hydration boundaries (Recommendation #10).

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
We agreed on a clear hierarchy: isolated auth screens → main layout with top nav (“Projects”, “Profile”) → project detail view with three tabs (“Notes”, “Plan”, "Logs"). The Notes tab will render a uniform card grid (infinite scroll) of notes (300 chars max, ellipsized) with a priority filter; clicking a card expands full text and edit form. The Plan tab will host a “Generate Plan” button that triggers a synchronous AI call: display an overlay spinner, disable the button, then render the returned schedule or show a retry toast on error. The Logs tab is deferred to a future admin panel. Profile preferences (multi-select autocomplete for categories) and project create/edit (date picker) will be built in the Profile and Project forms, with inline validation messages. State will be managed via React hooks and context initially; we’ll wire API calls through a centralized HTTP client (including JWT headers later). UI will be built in Astro with React components hydrated only where interactive, styled via Tailwind and Shadcn/ui primitives to meet WCAG AA standards. Loading states use overlay spinners, non-critical messages use toasts, and errors surface inline or via a global error boundary as needed.

<unresolved_issues>
- Choose and integrate an accessible date picker for project creation/edit forms.  
- Define the ProfilePreferences component UI and autocomplete data flow.  
- Specify toast library/configuration (position, style, timeout).  
- Detail client-side token storage, refresh strategy, and AuthGuard implementation.  
- Confirm caching or background-refetch strategy since React Query was not adopted initially.
